./drop.usage.description = Drops snippets identified by name, ID, or ID range, making them inactive. For a range of IDs, provide the starting ID and ending ID separated with a hyphen. To provide a list, separate the items in the list with a space. Use the /list command to see the IDs of code snippets.
./env.usage.description.0 = Displays the environment settings, or updates the environment settings and restarts the session.
./env.usage.description.1 = Updates the environment settings with the provided options.
./env.usage.description.2 = Resets the execution state.
./env.usage.description.3 = Runs the startup scripts.
./env.usage.description.4 = Silently replays the history in the order entered. The history includes all valid snippets or /drop commands entered at the jshell prompt, in scripts entered on the command line, or scripts entered with the /open command.
./help.usage.description = Displays information about commands.
./history.usage.description = Displays what was entered in this session.
./imports.usage.description = Displays the current active imports, including those from the startup scripts and scripts that were entered on the command line when JShell was started.
./list.usage.description = Displays a list of snippets and their IDs. If no option is entered, then all active snippets are displayed, but startup snippets aren't.
/list.-all = Displays all snippets, including startup snippets and snippets that failed, were overwritten, or were dropped.
/list.-start = Displays startup snippets that were evaluated when JShell was started.
./methods.usage.description = Displays information about the methods that were entered. If no option is entered, then the name, parameter types, and return type of all active methods are displayed.
/method.-all = Displays information for all methods, including those added when JShell was started, and methods that failed, were overwritten, or were dropped.
/method.start = Displays information for startup methods that were added when JShell was started.
./open.usage.description = Opens the file with script specified and reads the snippets into the JShell.
./open.usage.description.0 = The script can be a local file or one of the following predefined scripts:
./open.usage.description.1 = default - loads the default entries, which are commonly used as imports.
./open.usage.description.2 = printing - defines print, println, and printf as jshell methods for use within the session.
/open.default = Loads the default entries, which are commonly used as imports.
/open.printing = Defines print, println, and printf as jshell methods for use within the session.
./reload.usage.description =
./rerun.usage.description = Reruns the snippets identified by ID, range of IDs, or name. For a range of IDs, provide the starting ID and ending ID separated with a hyphen. To provide a list, separate the items in the list with a space. The first item in the list must be an ID or ID range. Use the /list command to see the IDs of the code snippets. The "rerun" name is optional, the ids may follow directly after /.
./reset.usage.description = Discards all entered snippets and restarts the session.
./reset.usage.description.0 = Resets the execution state.
./reset.usage.description.1 = Runs the startup scripts.
./reset.usage.description.2 = History is not replayed. All code that was entered is lost.
./reset.usage.description.3 = Environment settings are maintained.
